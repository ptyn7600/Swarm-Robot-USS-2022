# Swarm-Robot-USS-2022

## Progression
I will update what I had for a week in this section
|   Week      | Date        | Completion  |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|     1       | May 18th - May 20th   | - Use puTTy to connect w/ the BBBlue <br/> - Connect the BBBlue to wifi <br/> - Connect the BBB wirelessly|
|             | May 23th - May 30th   | - Run C/Python code on the BBBlue by using RC library <br/> - Be able to control the GPIO Pins (Blink the LEDs, read the Buttons) <br>|

Note for tommorow:
- Cannot read the ECHO pin of the ultrasonics -> Attach the button to check if the GPIO is set up correct (check the TRIG pin already by attaching the LED to it)

# Connect to the BBBlue Wirelessly

I use PuTTy to connect to the BBBlue wireless. Use SSH and IP address is 172.25.55.88, port is 22.
